**Problem Statement**

“LocalBuzz”  A Local Business Platform to Maximize Visibility and Increase Community Engagement
Many smaller businesses continue to struggle to effectively advertise to a large number of potential customers within their communities. Although social media is a great, cheap, tool they do use, it is difficult to determine if your page is being viewed by new people and if these people are then coming into your establishment as a customer. Many new businesses struggle to get their names out there in the first place regardless of social media accounts. There are not many other existing solutions for this issue that do not involve a waiting period for engagement to naturally increase overtime.


**Our Solution**


“Local Buzz” is a local business promotion platform. Privately owned businesses can advertise their unique products or services on this platform as well as create promotions or discounted offers to the users of the app. Users will be able to download and create profiles to see promotions within their communities and download digital promotions or discounts for these businesses. The platform will track the traffic that each business page gets, and the data can be made available to the business owner or whoever runs the account. The platform will also integrate with the business’ social media accounts, that way they can receive more engagement from that angle as well while using this platform.
 
 
**Mission Statement**

Our mission is to help local businesses thrive while having to compete with massive corporations and to bring people in the community together by making it simple and convenient to support local establishments.
System Proposal Request
Improved Service: Showing the interactions with owner’s pages and being able to track traffic to their promotions provides insight in to which strategies they should move forward with rather than having to guess.
Reduced Cost: Advertising and engaging on one platform rather than paying for ads in various print sources and web sources with no guarantee that people will see them
More Information: Current advertising methods do not provide the customer with accessible information to the traffic and engagement of their customers
